They had a nest in a tall, shady tree and there the mother bird took care of her little ones day and night.One day, there was a big storm. There was thunder, lightning and rain, and the wind blew down many trees. The tall tree in which the birds lived also came down. A big, heavy branch hit the nest and killed the bird. Fortunately for the baby birds, the strong wind blew them away to the other side of the forest. One of them came down near a cave where a gang of robbers lived. The other landed outside a rishi’s ashram a little distance away.Rationalised 2023-242/A Pact with the Sun'"

But he was sensible and clever like all monkeys. He kept a cool head. Calmly he said, “I’d do anything for you and your family. You are my only friend. After all, what is a monkey’s heart compared with the life of a crocodile’s wife? But how foolish could you be? Why didn’t you tell me before? I’d have brought my heart along.”“But where is your heart?” asked the crocodile innocently.“I thought you carried it all the time.”“Of course not. It’s there on the tree. Let’s swim back at once and get it. Your wife must be waiting,” replied the monkey gaining confidence.“Oh dear! What a mistake!” hissed the crocodile.

She was his life-partner after all. ‘I know it’s a sin to betray a friend, but I have no choice,’ he said to himself. ‘I’ll invite the monkey home and hope for the best.’“My wife wants you over for a meal, dear friend,” said the crocodile when he visited the monkey next. “You must come home with me today.”“With pleasure,” said the monkey. “I’m no swimmer, butcan ride on your back.” And they set out.In the middle of the river, where the current was the strongest, the crocodile could no longer hide his intention. “Sorry, my friend,” he said hesitatingly, “but I have to go under water now.
